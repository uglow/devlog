## Troubleshooting

### The date-stamp is in the wrong format!

The current version of `devlog` requires Node 14+, which contains the full set of
Internationalisation Components for Unicode (ICU). However, it is possible to 
install Node 14+ **without** Full ICU support. In this case, the default locale (en-US?)
is used by Node, even when `devlog` detects the operating system's actual locale.

To fix this, ensure you install Node 14+ **with full ICU support** (the default build).
Alternatively, you can try installing the [full-icu](https://www.npmjs.com/package/full-icu)
package (which has instructions for getting it working).
